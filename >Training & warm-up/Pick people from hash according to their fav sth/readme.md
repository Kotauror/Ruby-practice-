Write a program that groups people based on their favourite
things. In should:
* Ask the user to input a category - `sport` or `fruit`.
* Put the `people` into groups where each group has people who share
  the same favourite thing.
* Print out the names of the people in each group.  Before each
  group, it should say which favourite thing the people in the group
  share.

* Example output:
  ```
  Enter category to group people by
  sport
  squash
  Mary
  Lauren
  Govind
  weightlifting
  Isla
  Awad
  cycling
  Sam
  Will
  ```

Note: You can assume that, when asked for a category, the user will
only enter either `sport` or `fruit`.
