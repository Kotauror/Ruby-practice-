 Write a program that:
 * Calculates the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.
   * The first Fibonacci number is 0.
   * The second Fibonacci number is 1.
   * Every Fibonacci number after that is calculated by adding the
     previous two Fibonacci numbers together e.g. the third Fibonacci
     number is the result of `0 + 1`.
 * `puts`es these numbers, one per line.
