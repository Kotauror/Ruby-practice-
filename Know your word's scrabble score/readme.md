 Write a program that calculates the score for a word in Scrabble.
 It should:
 * Ask the user for a word e.g. `apple`.
 * `puts` the score for the word in Scrabble by totalling the points
   for each letter in the word.
   * Points for each letter:
     * 0 points: blank tile
     * 1 point: E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
     * 2 points: D, G
     * 3 points: B, C, M, P
     * 4 points: F, H, V, W, Y
     * 5 points: K
     * 8 points: J, X
     * 10 points: Q, Z
     
 * Note: You can assume that the user will enter a word that only
   contains letters and blanks.  You can assume the word will be in
   uppercase.
